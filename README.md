## What does this dbt package do?
- Materializes [Snapchat Ads staging tables](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_snapchat_ads_source/#!/overview/snapchat_ads_source/models/?g_v=1) which leverage data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/snapchat-ads/#schemainformation). These staging tables clean, test, and prepare your Snapchat Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/snapchat-ads) for analysis by doing the following:
  - Name columns for consistency across all packages and for easier analysis
  - Adds freshness tests to source data
    > dbt Core >= 1.9.6 is required to run freshness tests out of the box. See other options [here](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_snapchat_ads_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-change-for-dbt-core--196).
  - Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your Snapchat Ads data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_snapchat_ads_source/).
- These tables are designed to work simultaneously with our [Snapchat Ads transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_snapchat_ads).
    - Refer to our [Docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_snapchat_ads_source/#!/overview/salesforce_source/models/?g_v=1) for more details about these materialized models. 

## How do I use the dbt package?
### Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:
- At least one Fivetran Snapchat Ads connector syncing data into your destination.
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **Databricks**, or **PostgreSQL** destination.

#### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

### Step 2: Install the package (skip if also using the `snapchat_ads` transformation package or `ad_reporting` combination package)
If you are **not** using the [Snapchat Ads transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_snapchat_ads) and/or [Ad Reporting combination package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting), include the following package version in your `packages.yml` file. If you are installing the transform package, the source package is automatically installed as a dependency.
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/snapchat_ads_source
    version: [">=0.9.0", "<0.10.0"] # we recommend using ranges to capture non-breaking changes automatically
```
### Step 3: Configure your variables

#### Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `snapchat_ads_source` schema. If this is not where your Snapchat Ads data is (for example, if your Snapchat Ads schema is named `snapchat_ads_fivetran`), you would add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file with your custom database and schema names:

```yml
vars:
    snapchat_ads_database: your_destination_name
    snapchat_ads_schema: your_schema_name 
```

### (Optional) Step 4: Additional configurations
<details open><summary>Expand/Collapse details</summary>

#### Enabling models that are disabled by default
For certain models below, we have disabled them by default because of a smaller percentages of accounts syncing the underlying tables. To enable them, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    snapchat_ads__using_campaign_country_report: true # Necessary for the stg_snapchat_ads__campaign_geo_country_daily_report model. False by default. Requires the campaign_geo_country_daily_report
    snapchat_ads__using_campaign_region_report: true # Necessary for the stg_snapchat_ads__campaign_geo_region_daily_report model. False by default. Requires the campaign_geo_region_daily_report
```

#### Union multiple connections
If you have multiple snapchat_ads connections in Fivetran and would like to use this package on all of them simultaneously, we have provided functionality to do so. The package will union all of the data together and pass the unioned table into the transformations. You will be able to see which source it came from in the `source_relation` column of each model. To use this functionality, you will need to set either the `snapchat_ads_union_schemas` OR `snapchat_ads_union_databases` variables (cannot do both) in your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    snapchat_ads_union_schemas: ['snapchat_ads_usa','snapchat_ads_canada'] # use this if the data is in different schemas/datasets of the same database/project
    snapchat_ads_union_databases: ['snapchat_ads_usa','snapchat_ads_canada'] # use this if the data is in different databases/projects but uses the same schema name
```
> NOTE: The native `source.yml` connection set up in the package will not function when the union schema/database feature is utilized. Although the data will be correctly combined, you will not observe the sources linked to the package models in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This happens because the package includes only one defined `source.yml`.

To connect your multiple schema/database sources to the package models, follow the steps outlined in the [Union Data Defined Sources Configuration](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_utils/tree/releases/v0.4.latest#union_data-source) section of the Fivetran Utils documentation for the union_data macro. This will ensure a proper configuration and correct visualization of connections in the DAG.

#### Passing Through Additional Metrics
By default, this package will select `swipes`, `impressions`, `spend`, `conversion_purchases_value`, and `conversion_purchases` (or whichever fields are specified by the `snapchat_ads__conversion_fields` variable in the next section) from the source reporting tables to store into the staging models. If you would like to pass through additional metrics to the staging models, add the below configurations to your `dbt_project.yml` file. These variables allow for the pass-through fields to be aliased (`alias`) if desired, but not required. Use the below format for declaring the respective pass-through variables:

```yml
vars:
    snapchat_ads__ad_hourly_passthrough_metrics: 
      - name: "new_custom_field"
        alias: "custom_field_alias"
        transform_sql: "coalesce(custom_field_alias, 0)" # reference the `alias` here if you are using one
      - name: "unique_int_field"
        alias: "field_id"
      - name: "another_one"
        transform_sql: "coalesce(another_one, 0)" # reference the `name` here if you're not using an alias
    snapchat_ads__ad_squad_hourly_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "this_field"
    snapchat_ads__campaign_hourly_report_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "unique_string_field"
        alias: "field_id"
    snapchat_ads__campaign_daily_country_report_passthrough_metrics: # from `campaign_geo_country_daily_report`
      - name: "new_measure_country_report"
    snapchat_ads__campaign_daily_region_report_passthrough_metrics: # from `campaign_geo_region_daily_report`
      - name: "new_measure_region_report"
```

> **Note**: Make sure to exercise due diligence when adding metrics to these models. The metrics added by default (swipes, impressions, spend, and conversions) have been vetted by the Fivetran team, maintaining this package for accuracy. There are metrics included within the source reports, such as metric averages, which may be inaccurately represented at the grain for reports created in this package. You must ensure that whichever metrics you pass through are appropriate to aggregate at the respective reporting levels in this package.

**Important**: You do NOT need to add conversions in this way. See the following section for an alternative implementation.

#### Configuring Conversion Fields
Separate from the above passthrough metrics, the package will also include conversion metrics based on the `snapchat_ads__conversion_fields` variable, in addition to the `conversion_purchases_value` field.

By default, the data models consider `conversion_purchases` to be conversions. These should cover most use cases, but, say, if you would like to consider adding payment info, adding to wishlist, adding to the cart, etc. to also be conversions, you would apply the following configuration with the **original** source names of the conversion fields (not aliases you provided in the section above):

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
vars:
    snapchat_ads__conversion_fields: ['conversion_purchases', 'conversion_add_billing', 'conversion_save', 'conversion_add_cart']
```

> We introduced support for conversion fields in our `*_hourly_report` data models in the [v0.7.0 release](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_snapchat_ads_source/releases/tag/v0.7.0) of the package, but customers might have been bringing in these conversion fields earlier using the passthrough fields variables. The data models will avoid "duplicate column" errors automatically if this is the case.

#### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable. This is not available when running the package on multiple unioned connections.

> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_snapchat_ads_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.
    
```yml
vars:
    snapchat_ads_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```

#### Change the build schema
By default, this package builds the Snapchat Ads staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_stg_snapchat_ads`) in your destination. If this is not where you would like your Snapchat Ads staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    snapchat_ads_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
